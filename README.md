# Microsoft Custom Vision and Azure Notebooks - Deep Learning: using Fashion MNIST Dataset

> “I need to sort out my wardrobe” 

*Image classification of fashion items using Deep Learning* - Classifying numbers and letters is so last season .. Let’s classify our wardrobes instead! Learn all about the in’s and out’s of image classification using deep learning. 

In this 2 hour workshop we will offer two forms of image classification using deep learning. One will be using the Microsoft Custom Vision service and transfer learning, and the other will be using the Microsoft Azure Notebooks and the deep learning API, Keras. 

Both exercises will show you, step-by-step, how to classify clothing into categories such as dresses, t-shirts, sandals, trainers etc. The dataset we will use will be the Fashion MNIST dataset from Zalando the online fashion brand: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
